```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This homework is more or less a tutorial that helps you set up the coding environment used in this course, and familiarizes you with the format of the assignment submission. 
As a pre-requisite of this homework, first install R, and then the RStudio (the free version of Rstudio Desktop). 

Please respond to all questions. If the question asks you to do something on your laptop and you have finished that, just say "Done". 

1. Create a folder named `ds202_hw1`, and **either** create an RMarkDown file `hw1_FirstName_LastName.Rmd` under this folder **or** move the provided template into this folder. 
Replace `FirstName` and `LastName` with your first and last name. 
`hw1_FirstName_LastName.Rmd` will include your solutions. The file and folder names are *case-sensitive*, which means `hw1.Rmd` and `HW1.rmd` are different. *It is crucial to follow the exact folder structure and file names* in this course, so that your homework can be reproduced. The correct folder structure is

    ```
    ds202_hw1
    |-- hw1_FirstName_LastName.Rmd
    |-- hw1_FirstName_LastName.html (generated after knitting)
    ```
    
    Answer: Done

2. Write your name in the YAML of your homework `Rmd` file.

    Answer: Done

3. Write a paragraph to introduce yourself. Set your name in bold font and your major in italic. 

    Answer: Hi! My name is **Kyle Schallau**. I am a triple major in *Computer Science*, *Economics*, and *Environmental Studies*. I am currently a senior at ISU, but I still have one more year after this year. My hometown is Le Mars, Iowa. My favorite activities include golfing, fishing, exercising outdoors, and traveling.
  
4. Write a paragraph describing a job that you think is related to data science. Include a hyperlink and an image. Make sure your answer is in a nice format to read. 

    Answer: A job that is related to data science is forensics evidence becuase of all the data, pieces of evidence, that are involved in the job. Data Science involves using various methods to retrieve the most important data. This is very important in forensics evidence in order to solve a crime. Other parts of the job that are similar include anazlying the data, removing bad data, making the data meaningful, and presenting the data. The link I found is from a website on data science in forensicsevidence. https://www.controlrisks.com/our-services/applying-technology-solutions/forensic-data-analytics

5. What data topic will you be most interested in? (Optional) Provide a source of such dataset if you have.

    Answer: I'm very interested in nearly all types of data science work, but a topic in data that I am interested in is transportation. I like learning about factors that go into getting people or goods from one place to another in less time, while ensuring a safe and more cost effective form of transportation. I don't have a dataset yet.   
  
6. To check that your R and Rstudio installation is correct, find the version of R by entering `version` into the R console. Include this command into a R code trunk in your solution `Rmd` file to have it automatically printed in the knitted html file. 

    Answer: 
    ```{r}
    R.version
    ```
  
7. Install git. 
    - If you are on Windows: 
        a. Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). In the coming weeks we will use the Git Bash (but not the Git GUI). 
        b. After installation, set up Rstudio to use Git bash as the shell for the Terminal: Open RStudio, click Tools--Global Options--Terminal; under **Shells**, select Git Bash; click OK. 
        c. In the main menu of RStudio: click Tools--Terminal--New Terminal. If you have a `$` before your prompt, then you should be good to go.
        d. If you don't see a `$` before your prompt, try restarting RStudio.
    - If you are on Linux or macOS, Git has probably been installed by default, so you do not need to install anything. Just click the Terminal tab (above the R Console).

    Answer: Done
  
8. What is the version of your Git? To find out, go to the Terminal tab in RStudio (right to the Console tab), and type in the following command. If it works, this shows that the setup of your terminal and Git is correct. 
<!-- Then explore the bash command line and Git. -->

    ```
    git --version
    ```

    Answer: 2.33.0.windows.2
  
9. Configure your git username and user email by modifying and entering the following commands into the terminal

    ```
    git config --global user.name "your first and last name"
    git config --global user.email "your email"
    ```

    Answer: Done
  

10. Register a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account. What is your username?
